1. Original Visualization

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7038221922265915394/

I chose this visualization, becuase when i looked at it first time, I was surprised to see that China is the global leader in tomato production.
Having experience of working with economic policy making for my country, I had always thought of Italy as the global leader in tomato production. 
I realized that sharing this visualization would be interesting in terms of highlighting how China rose to the top slot in global tomato production, whhile it almost started from the same level as Russia and many other countries in 1981.

This visualization succinctly conveys the message that China has outpaced all other countries in this agricultural sector, 
which is a significant point of discussion for agroeconomists, policymakers, and industry stakeholders. 


2. For each step detailed above, you should document your progress as you moved forward.  
In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   
You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  
You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  
Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  
Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, a
nd what you attempted to show or do differently. 

You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.). 

My first thought after critiquing this visualization was that main take away of this visualization is being blurred by the overload of information. I though I only need to foucs on the change in production levels of top countries both in 1981 and 2021. I created my sketch only to highlight this trend. 
Though I could highlight this in my sketch, but after getting the feedback, I realized it is also important to capture the historical information to give context to the viewer. 



MY first critique came from a friend, who is also a batch mate. She is 28 years old. 
My first critique response on my sketch was like this
Can you tell me what you think this is?
I think this is the production of tomatoes of various countries in 1981 versus 2021. 
The production unit is thousands of tonnes, but I am confused if the x-axis is already into thousands or do we have to interpret it 
by adding thousands next to the numbers.
I am particularly started to see Spain so low, because in my mind there is certain association between tomatoes and Spain due to t
heir La Tomatino festival I guess, I am also suprised to see Turkey there, I have not really conceived Turkey as an agrarian country e
ver so that is a surprise.
I also would have expected Russia to be in the top 5 at least, since there is a perception that Russia is self-sustaining when it comes to basic food items.

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
I am not sure who really is the intended audience, without more context. Maybe it is for policymakers who are responsible for f
ood security policy. 
Maybe it is for farmers, I am not really sure, but I beleive that the visualization is simple enough that anyone can easily understand it.

Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I feel like the colors are giving an old-ish vibe, I would change the shade of these colors to a bit more brighter blue and yellow.
Bar chart is a good choice of visualization I believe, but I would think about how can highlight the top 5, if that is my story. 
I would group the rest as 'others', or I would color them all grey, so that they don't take away attention from the main top 5 countries. 
Point is that title mentions the word 'leaders', 10 countries cannot be leaders, so gotta reduce the number of countries there I believe. 
The zeroes in unit on x-axis are also a bit redundant, you could simply write 200000, as 2 and then at the end of the axis or start of the axis write 'million' or whatever the appropriate unit is here. 
I may also add the exact values in each bar, so if anyone wants that kinda specific information, they don't have to peruse through the 
whole visualization. If you are making this in tableau, you could add year as filter as well. For context, if you have data available, consider adding the data. 

The second critique came from a friend who is a Phd Student, and is around 32 years old. The second critique came out like this: 

Okay, first up, the chart's got a pretty solid 'then and now' thing going with the tomato production stats. But honestly, I'm clueless about the whole story here. Like, why pick 1981 and 2021? Did something epic happen in the world of tomatoes then? A little blurb to set the scene would be super helpful.
Colors could use an upgrade to something that pops more, something that makes me go 'Wow, look at how things have changed!' instead of 'Hmm, interesting.'
And the data on the x-axis, we're talking 'thousands of tonnes' here, but you have to squint to see that. It could use a shoutout right on the chart, so it's super clear what we're looking at.
Highlighting the big shots in tomato production is cool and all, but calling ten countries 'leaders' feels like a stretch. Why not shine a brighter light on the top few? 
The zeros on the axis are a bit overkill. We can all count zeros, right? Just put the actual number up there, put in a 'millions' label for good measure.
Give the bars number labels. 
You need to add something more to this chart to make it look attractive.

After getting these two detailed feedbacks, I also recieved somewaht similar pointers on feedback in tuesday's class, and I realized that I can't just simply let go of the historical data. Particularly when i have that available so easily. So I started thinking about how to paint the full picture, but to also not make overwhelming for the audience. 
After some rumination, I thought of highlighting the shift from 1981 to 2019 through a line chart, and highlighting China and Russia, and keeping all the other countries in greys. China needed to be highlighted for obvious reasons, but i really wanted to show the shift of tomato production in Russia. It came from top to bottom during this time period. So, I created a line chart using these points. 

After I was done with line chart, It still looked boring to me, so i thought of trying something interactive. I searched online if i could use this data on a map, and make it interactive. I got to know that we can do it tableu through pages, and I tried that. In my map visualization, you can play the visualization through years, and that looks really cool. 



3.  Your final data visualization!
