# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! 

# About me
Hi, I am Uzma. I am a second year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am majoring in Public Policy, and Management with Data Analytics. I have experience of working with national level public policy. In my current program at Carnegie Mellon University, I am learning using data analytics for data driven decision making in the sphere of public policy. After my graduation, I aim to use my experience in public policy and my data skills to develop and implement policy changes that help people live better lives. I am planning to work for government agencies, or multilateral organizations.


# What I hope to learn
As businesses and industries increasingly rely on data to drive their operations, there's a growing demand for professionals skilled in data visualization. With clearer insights from visual data, individuals and businesses can make more informed decisions. Whether it's determining the success of a marketing campaign, monitoring product sales, or making strategic business decisions, effective data visualization can guide the way. So, through this course I hope to learn creating effective visualizations from available data, and using those visualizations to tell the story of present data.

Moreover, as I plan to work in the public policy sphere after i graduate, data visualization skills become even more important and relevant in this area. In essence, data visualization in the public policy area transforms vast and complicated datasets into comprehensible visuals, ensuring that policies are data-driven, transparent, and have the intended impact on the community.

Additionally, public policies impact millions of lives. I can use my data visualization skills to help policymakers understand complex datasets, making it easier to make decisions that are well-informed and evidence-based.

## Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
