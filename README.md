This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! 

# About me
Hi, I am Uzma. I am a second year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am majoring in Public Policy, and Management with Data Analytics. I have experience of working with national level public policy. In my current program at Carnegie Mellon University, I am learning using data analytics for data driven decision making in the sphere of public policy. After my graduation, I aim to use my experience in public policy and my data skills to develop and implement policy changes that help people live better lives. I am planning to work for government agencies, or multilateral organizations.


# What I hope to learn
As businesses and industries increasingly rely on data to drive their operations, there's a growing demand for professionals skilled in data visualization. With clearer insights from visual data, individuals and businesses can make more informed decisions. Whether it's determining the success of a marketing campaign, monitoring product sales, or making strategic business decisions, effective data visualization can guide the way. So, through this course I hope to learn creating effective visualizations from available data, and using those visualizations to tell the story of present data.

Moreover, as I plan to work in the public policy sphere after i graduate, data visualization skills become even more important and relevant in this area. In essence, data visualization in the public policy area transforms vast and complicated datasets into comprehensible visuals, ensuring that policies are data-driven, transparent, and have the intended impact on the community.

Additionally, public policies impact millions of lives. I can use my data visualization skills to help policymakers understand complex datasets, making it easier to make decisions that are well-informed and evidence-based.

## Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)

## Summary
Source of the dataset in the visualization is The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The dataset has government debt to GDP ratio for 35 countries from 1995 to 2019. Government debt to GDP ratio signifies debt sustainability for a country. 

Using this data, I wanted to create this visualization for public, as I was surprised to see that Japan has the highest debt to GDP ratio in the world. I have always seen discussion on China and USA, in terms of global debt. As the data on Japan was only available until 2017, and I really wanted to highlight Japan and the other two top countries, I truncated my data to 2017 only. I looked up if there was any reversal in trends for Japan for 2018 and 2019, however Japan maintained the trend of being on top in 2018 and 2019 as well. So, I thought it reasonable to truncate my data to convey my message reasonably well. 

After experimenting with map and bar chart for this data, I chose line graph for this data for plotting all available countries across available years. Though a choropleth map was a suitable visualization for this data, however as the available data is only available for around 35 countries, the countries for which data is not available displayed simple gray color. I realized that this could divert the focus from the main takeaway and might look misleading as well. 

I wanted to highlight in this visualization that Japan has been on top, and kind of like an outlier, in terms of debt to GDP ratio, for almost two decades. Greece and Italy have recorded sharp increase in their debt to GDP ratio since 2011 as well.
