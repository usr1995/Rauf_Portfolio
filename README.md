This is my public portfolio for telling stories with data.

# About me
Hi, I am Uzma. I am a second year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am majoring in Public Policy, and Management with Data Analytics. I have experience of working with national level public policy. In my current program at Carnegie Mellon University, I am learning using data analytics for data driven decision making in the sphere of public policy. After my graduation, I aim to use my experience in public policy and my data skills to develop and implement policy changes that help people live better lives. I am planning to work for government agencies, or multilateral organizations.


# What I hope to learn
As businesses and industries increasingly rely on data to drive their operations, there's a growing demand for professionals skilled in data visualization. With clearer insights from visual data, individuals and businesses can make more informed decisions. Whether it's determining the success of a marketing campaign, monitoring product sales, or making strategic business decisions, effective data visualization can guide the way. So, through this course I hope to learn creating effective visualizations from available data, and using those visualizations to tell the story of present data.

Moreover, as I plan to work in the public policy sphere after i graduate, data visualization skills become even more important and relevant in this area. In essence, data visualization in the public policy area transforms vast and complicated datasets into comprehensible visuals, ensuring that policies are data-driven, transparent, and have the intended impact on the community.

Additionally, public policies impact millions of lives. I can use my data visualization skills to help policymakers understand complex datasets, making it easier to make decisions that are well-informed and evidence-based.
