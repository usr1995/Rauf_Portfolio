## Summary: Food Wastage in United States due to confusion about food labels.
Food wastage is a significant global issue, with substantial impacts on both the environment and economies. Global food waste is about 1.3 billion tons annually. The total food that is produced but never eaten is estimated to be sufficient to feed two billion people. On the environmental front, noting that food loss and waste, if considered a country, would rank as the third largest source of greenhouse gas emissions globally.
The United Nations Environment Programmer’s 2021 Food Waste Index revealed that around 931 million tons of food are discarded each year. Of this, households contribute the most, at 569 million tons, with the food service and retail sectors adding 244 million and 118 million tons, respectively. The UNEP's data suggests that consumer-level food waste is more than double previous estimates by the FAO. 
Among countries, China and India lead in food waste, with 91.6 million and 68.8 million tons respectively. The U.S. ranks third in terms of food waste in the world and sees households discarding around 19.4 million tons of food annually. in contrast to developing countries where around 40 percent of the losses occur at the processing or post-harvest levels, in industrialized countries, more than 40 percent of losses happen at retail and consumer levels. Bottom of Form
In united states, a round 40% of the food supply is discarded each year. A substantial portion of this waste occurs in households, primarily due to confusion surrounding food labels. Confusion over date labeling is believed to be a significant factor in food wastage, accounting for approximately 7% of all food waste in the United States. This includes food that could have been safely eaten or donated. Consumers often misinterpret "Best By" and "Sell By" dates as indicators of safety, leading to the unnecessary disposal of perfectly edible food.
In united states, federal law does not mandate national food dating systems for products other than infant formula, leaving it outside the compulsory requirements of federal food safety agencies. This results into a non-standard use of food labels across states. According to the Food Marketing Institute (FMI), over 10 distinct explanatory phrases for date labels are found on food packaging. These range from "sell by" and "use by" to "best by," "fresh until," "use or freeze by," "enjoy before," and "expires on." These labels are meant to inform retailers and consumers about a product's shelf life, optimal quality, and aid in managing in-store inventory. Typically, these labels focus on quality rather than safety, and are not uniformly regulated at the federal level, with variations in state and global regulations. The diverse terminology used by manufacturers often leads to consumer confusion, with many mistaking these labels as indicators of food safety, resulting in unnecessary food wastage.
Implementing uniform date labeling language through federal legislation has the potential to significantly diminish consumer confusion and the resulting food waste in U.S. homes and businesses. This standardization, which would come at a minimal cost to both government and industry, may redirect around 398,000 tons of food waste, providing an economic benefit of approximately $1.8 billion to the United States.
To tackle the issue of food waste due to food labelling, The Food Date Labeling Act of 2023 was introduced in Congress to limit the variety of phrases used on product labels and clearly differentiate between food safety and quality issues.
The Act proposes a standardized language for food date labels to alleviate consumer confusion and improve understanding. The implementation of this Act could prevent over half a million tons of food waste from entering landfills annually.
Simplification of Date Labels: The Act proposes to streamline the variety of date labels into two primary categories:
BEST If Used By: This label indicates when a product is at its peak quality. It's not a safety date but rather a suggestion for optimal taste or texture.
USE By: This label is more critical as it relates to food safety. It suggests when a product should no longer be consumed due to potential health risks.
Reducing Confusion: By limiting the labels to these two distinct categories, the Act would significantly reduce the confusion currently caused by the myriad of labels like "sell by," "use or freeze by," "expires on," etc. Consumers would have a clearer understanding of what each label means, leading to better decision-making about food consumption and waste.
Consumer Education: Alongside simplifying labels, the Act likely includes measures for consumer education to ensure the public understands the new labeling system. Educating consumers about the meaning of these labels and their implications on food quality and safety is crucial for the Act's success.
Preventing Premature Disposal: With clearer labels, consumers would be less likely to prematurely dispose of food that is still safe and good to eat. This change is expected to lead to a reduction in household food waste.
Encouraging Food Donations: With clearer labeling, it would be easier for retailers and consumers to donate food that is close to or past the "BEST If Used By" date but still safe to consume, thus supporting food donation initiatives and reducing food insecurity.
In summary, the Food Date Labeling Act of 2023 would help consumers by simplifying date labeling on food products, reducing confusion, educating the public, decreasing unnecessary food waste, and providing economic and environmental benefits.
The Food Date Labeling Act of 2023, introduced on May 9, 2023, is currently in the first stage of the legislative process. It has not yet passed in Congress and is expected to be reviewed by a committee before potentially proceeding to the House or Senate for further consideration.
My aim through this project is to inform my audience about the newer and simplified data labels that the Food Date Labeling Act of 2023 proposes, so that as soon as this act is passed and data labels on food products are standardized across the United States, they can make informed decisions about food consumption. 



## OUTLINE
Introduction: I plan to start off with presenting the global context of food waste, introducing the scope and scale with statistics to set the stage for the importance of the issue. Following this, I plan to define the specific challenge within the United States, emphasizing the confusion caused by current food labeling practices and its contribution to food waste.
Discussion on existing framework: in this section, I plan to discuss the existing regulatory environment, highlighting the lack of standardized date labels except for infant formula and how this varies across states and internationally. I plan to follow this with the impact analysis, by analyzing the environmental and economic impacts of food waste due to labeling confusion, utilizing data to illustrate the potential savings and environmental benefits of reducing waste.
Proposed Solution: in this section, I plan to Introduce the Food Date Labeling Act of 2023, detailing how standardizing date labels can alleviate confusion, with a focus on the specific changes proposed by the Act. After this, I plan to outline the importance of consumer education as part of the Act and how it could transform consumer behavior, reduce waste, and encourage food donations.
Expected Outcomes: in this section, I aim to project the potential positive outcomes of the Act, such as the reduction in food waste and the associated economic value.
Conclusion and Call to Action: in this last section, I would summarize the key points and encourage readers to support the act and adopt more mindful consumption practices in anticipation of its passage and be educated about the new labels so that as soon as the act is passed and new labels start coming on the food products, they can make the full use of them.

## Data sets:
The primary data source will be the UNEP Food Waste Index Report 2021. This comprehensive report provides extensive data on food waste at both retail and consumer levels globally and will serve as a foundation for my analysis.
The UNEP report is a valuable repository of information, offering insights into the scale of food waste and its environmental impact. It details statistics such as the 931 million tons of food wasted each year and the breakdown of waste by sector.
I will use this data to quantify the problem of food wastage in the United States and to compare it with global trends. By highlighting specific figures from the report, I can create compelling visualizations that depict the magnitude of food wastage linked to labeling confusion. Additionally, the report's data will underpin arguments for the necessity of standardized labeling as proposed by the Food Date Labeling Act of 2023.

In addition to the UNEP Food Waste Index Report, project will utilize the issue brief from the Harvard Law School's Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation (CHLPI), which discusses the complexities of food date labeling in the United States. The brief provides analysis of how date labeling impacts food waste, consumer behavior, and legal frameworks.
The CHLPI issue brief sheds light on state-level inconsistencies in date labeling laws and their consequences. It will be helful in detailing the legislative landscape surrounding food labeling and the potential for reform through federal legislation.
I plan to extract data on consumer perceptions and behaviors regarding date labels, as well as information on existing state laws that contribute to labeling confusion. This will help in constructing a case for the Food Date Labeling Act by showing the current challenges and the benefits of standardization. The brief’s findings will be cited to support advocacy for the proposed changes in labeling laws, and visualizations will reflect the data on discrepancies in labeling practices and their impacts.
