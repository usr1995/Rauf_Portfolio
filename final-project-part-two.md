## 2. User research protocol

I interviewed three people for my shorthand draft. The first person is a software engineer, and 26 years old, residing in Pittsburgh. 
The second person is my classmate in this course, and third interviewee is also a friend at CMU but her major is different from mine. 

My interview script consisted of the following questions that I asked my interviewees. I started off by explaining the purpose of interview and how their feedback will be used. Following this, I asked them following questions:

1.	Having read the story, what was your initial impression?
2.	Was there a particular part of the story that you found most engaging or informative?
3.	Were there any areas or aspects of the story that you found confusing or unclear?"
4.	How did you find the flow and structure of the story? Were there any points where you felt the story lagged or lost focus
5.	What are your thoughts on the visual elements used in the story? Did they enhance your understanding of the topic?"
6.	In terms of the message and impact, do you feel the story effectively conveyed the importance of reducing food waste? Why or why not?"
7.	Was the call to action in the story clear and compelling? Did it inspire you to think or act differently about food waste?
8.	Do you have any suggestions for how the story could be improved, either in content or presentation?
9.	Do you have any additional comments or feedback that you think could help improve the story?
10.	How do you think is the target audience for this story?


## 3. User research findings
As one of my interviewees was from this same class and the other two were not related to any course material in this course, I found a difference in the feedback that I got from my classmate versus the feedback I got from the other two interviewees. 

The first interviewees was kind of impressed with the story, and said all the good things about the story. He even told me that, “Yes - the visuals make it memorable, and the tone makes it persuasive”. HE was kind of surprised to know that household food wastage was the highest food wastage in USA, and he said this for one of the interview questions, “Yes - I had no idea about us as household individuals contributing the most to this!” He did state this when I asked him about visual elements in the story, “House food wastage visual was very engaging.”
He also was persuaded by the story to act on call to action. 

The second person I interviewed did also like the overall story and was kind of impressed by the overall flow and visualizations of the story. About the visualizations she said that, “Yes, I found the part which shows the percentages of food wastage and ways to avoid food wastage super interesting.” And about the potential improvements and additions to the story, she said that I can look at “You can probably mention some startups that are working to prevent food wastage. I really liked this insight from her, and for the third part, I am going to look for the startups. When I asked her if she was motivated enough to act on the call to action, she replied that, “Yes, the story inspired me. I will try my best not to waste my food anymore.”

The third person I interviewed is also a classmate in this class with me, and he very critically analyzed my story. He said that he liked the flow of the content and call to action, but he did point out a lot of places for improvement in the overall design of my story. He did point out that when one part of the story transitions into the other, it feels not very smooth in terms of changing layout of the story pages. He also told me that I have used some pictures only as filler pictures, and they were redundant, and I need to get rid of them or use some useful pictures in their place. He particularly pointed out the picture on the last slide of “Call to Action”. He also told me to add more data visualizations, as he thought that two visualizations are not enough. He also pointed out that I need to make my headings more captivating and the current ones look boring. He also told me to add intallation QR code in the call to action part, when i ask audience to "Get the FoodKeeper App". When he looked at my visualization, he asked me where did i make it, and i had made it in excel. He told me that if you make these visualizations in tableu, you can also embed them in the story. I am also going to do the same in the third step. 
All of my interviewees could also identify that the audience of this story is people living in pittsburgh, through call to action.

I would impalement almost all the changes in my third and final part that this last interviewee pointed out. I really liked the fact that his critique was very deep and insightful. I think in my third and final part, I would focus more on improving the design and would only focus on tweaking the content of the story
