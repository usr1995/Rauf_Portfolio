## The final data story

## Changes made since Part II
On thursday, I realized that my my shorthand story in part II was very basic and was not shaping up like a story. So, on thursday I went for a new interview to get ideas on how to make my story look like a proper one. 

This time i went to another class mate from the data telling stories class, whose short hand story i really liked in the presentation. I went to him to ask for specific points that should be changed in my story. He pointed out the following things to me, and i totally agreed with his points as we.
My story had changing color scheme, and there were no major visualizations in my story. 
First thing that i neeeded to do was to get a template which had a consistent color scheme. I chose the template which had black and orange color scheme through out. It looked suitable to me for my story as the vibrant colors would not have suited my topic. 
After finding a template, I needed to work on the flow. I started working on the flow of the story. I had to remove the global food waste as the starting point of my story because after trying very hard, I had been unable to link up the flow to US food waste from the global food waste. The USA remained on the third rank both in terms of total food waste, and also in terms of per capita food waste as well. So, I couldn't really find data enough to make this transition smooth. So i ended up removing the global part. After removing the global part, story seemed to be really weird to start off with statistics, so i though of startign off with a story. I inserted a very short story about thanksgiving as food waste increases on thanksgiving and as it was very recent so it seemed more natural to me to start off with thanksgiving story.

In my part 2, there was only one visualization which also was not adding much to the story and i had made that in excel and pasted it as an image which looked very crude and out of the place in the story. So, in part 3, I got more supporting data, and though i could only find data that was only for one year, as food waste data is not regularly compiled. So, I had to make use of those one year data sets for differnt areas of story, like the break down of presishable items. However this time, I switched to Tableu for visualizations,and it was a really nice experience to embed those visualizations in the short hand story. I didn't know in the part 2, if we could also embed the visualizations directly from tableu, otherwise I would have never tried excel. 
I could find the two data sets for 2021. One dataset was about the breakdown of how much food we eat and how much we waste. This dataset was insightful, so i used it to support my statistics in my opening slide. The second dataset that i found was about the exact percentages of different perishable items that were wasted in 2021. As these numbers don't change drastically from one year to another, so i assumed that 2021 data was a representative of the neignboring years as well. I added this data set to make the analysis of food waste from very macro level to somewhat micro level so that it could feel relatable for an average person. I also added this new data set about the food scarcity in USA. 

I also used a lot more Canva during part 3, as compared with part 2. I really enjoyed using and making new visualizations in Canva. I also tried making icon array visualizations with this website, iconarray.com. As the data about the food insecurity was that "1 in 10 American is food insecure, however on this website I couldn't reduce the number of icons below zero. So, to maintain the proportion I kept the total number of incon-arrays to 100 and increased the food insecure number to 10. 

I also modified my call of action part. In my part 2, there was a lot of text in call to action part, which you had pointed out during disscussion to me. So, I made call to action points more direct and actionable. I removed unnecessary text and made the bullet points of all the important and necessary information, so that it becomes easy for audience to take way the actionable items from the story. in part 3, I also added a QR code for installing the FoodKeeper app, and i generated it through canva. I did it so that it becomes easy for audience to act on call to action. 

In part 3, I also added sources for all the photos that i had used.  

I also added some major sections, like when i finished talking about the scale of the food waste in USA, I put in a heading style "The other side of story" to indicate to the audience that now we would talk about something different/opposite. In this section I wanted to highlight the other side, which doesn't even get enough food to survive in the same country where there the scale of food waste is huge.I also introduced another section for switching course towards "call to action" part. I put in a new heading here, "From Awareness to Action", to guide the viewer towards the action part. 

I also added few concluding sentences in part 3, which were missing in part 2. 


## Audience
I had maintained my audience to be pittsburgh population,and this is why I put in the names of the food banks in pittsburgh for donating excess food. 

## Final Thoughts
To me, it seems like most of the work I have done in part 3, and for part 2 though i did work on the story alot but i had been unable to shape it properly. I was way distracted in my part 2, and was not focused much in terms of content.  Overall, part 3 this has been an amazing learning experience in putting together everything in a better way.
